"""
You have a file that has the radius of a circle, one per line.
Create a program that performs the following:
Defines a function called "diameter"
Accepts the radius (floating point) as a parameter
Calculates and returns the diameter of the circle, (2 times radius)
Defines a function called "circumference"
Accepts the radius (floating point) as a parameter
Calculates and returns the circumference of the circle, (2 times pi times radius)
Defines a function called "area"
Accepts the radius (floating point) as a parameter
Calculates and returns the area of the circle, (pi times radius squared)
Opens and reads the 06.01 Radius.txt file
Calculates and prints the radius, diameter, circumference, and area on a line. (each value is 15 columns wide, 5 decimal digits, and a space seperating each column.
Print headings that right align with the data.
