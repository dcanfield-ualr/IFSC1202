Opens the file 06.03 FTemps.txt file for reading
Opens the file 06.03 CTemps.txt file for writing
Reads a line from the 06.03 FTemps.txt file
Calculates the Celsius temperature.
Writes the Celsius temperature to the 06.03 CTemps.txt file. The Celsius values should be 5 characters wide with 1 decimal digit.
