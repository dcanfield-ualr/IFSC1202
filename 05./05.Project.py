"""
Create a program that displays special numbers in a range. A special number is defined to be number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.
153 is 3 digits long and is equal to 13 + 53 + 33
8208 is 4 digits long and is equal to 84 + 24 + 04 + 84
Hint: First determine the number of digits using a while loop and reminder division by 10. Do not use any string functions or the LEN function.
Hint: Recalculate the value using the power from above and see if you get the original value
Do not use the len function to determine the number of digits.
